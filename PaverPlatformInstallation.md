## Paver Platform Installation Guide

### Preparation

1. **Mark the Perimeter of Your Platform:** 
    - Begin by marking out the area where you'll be installing your paver platform. You can use your [tape measure](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Kobalt-Project-Source-25FT-Tape-Measure/5002026353) to measure a 4-foot by 4-foot area. Once measured, use [landscape stakes](https://www.lowes.com/pd/12-Pack-12-in-Wood-Landscape-Stake/1000404377) at each corner of the square to mark the perimeter. Drive the first stake into the ground at one corner using your hand or the [rubber mallet](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Project-Source-16-oz-Smooth-Face-Rubber-Head-Wood-Rubber-Mallet/5013702145).

2. **Attach Strings and Drive Remaining Stakes:** 
    - Once your first stake is in place, attach your [fluorescent orange nylon mason line string](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Marshalltown-250-ft-Fluorescent-Orange-Nylon-Mason-Line-String/5001845385) to the stake. Extend the string to where the next stake will be placed. Use the string as a guide to ensure the stakes are aligned. Drive the remaining stakes into the ground at the other corners, ensuring they are in line with the string and the stakes are vertical. Attach the string to each stake as you go, creating a square outline.

3. **Check the Square:** 
    - With your square marked out, it's time to make sure that it's actually square. Measure diagonally from one corner to another, and then from the other two corners. Both measurements should be the same. Adjust your stakes and strings as needed until they are. 

### Base Layer Installation

4. **Dig the Area:** 
    - Using the [square nose shovel](https://www.harborfreight.com/56-in-square-nose-shovel-69791.html), dig out the area inside your strings to a depth of about 6 inches. This will be the base layer for your platform, which will provide stability and help with drainage.

5. **Install the Gravel:** 
    - Pour the [gravel](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Sakrete-0-5-cu-ft-Gray-Gravel/1000489233) into the dug-out area. Use your shovel to spread the gravel evenly across the entire area, ensuring that it fills any low spots. This should be about 4 inches thick. 

6. **Compact the Gravel:** 
    - Use the [hand tamper](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Kobalt-10-in-x-10-in-Tamper-with-Steel-Handle/5005462239) to compact the gravel. This will create a firm and stable base for your platform. Make sure the surface of the gravel is as flat as possible. You can use your [48-in I-beam level](https://www.lowes.com/pd/CRAFTSMAN-48-in-I-beam-Level/1000596129) to check this.

7. **Install the Sand:** 
    - Pour the [sand](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Sakrete-50-lb-All-purpose-Sand/1000489239) over the compacted gravel. Use your shovel to spread it evenly across the entire area, creating a layer that's approximately 2 inches thick. 

8. **Compact and Level the Sand:** 
    - Use the hand tamper again to compact the sand. After compacting, use the 48-in I-beam level to ensure that the surface is level. If you find any high or low spots, add or remove sand as necessary and compact again. 

9. **Install the Landscape Fabric:** 
    - Cut the [landscape fabric](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Scotts/5004685485) to fit the area using your [utility knife](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Project-Source-Project-Source-Retractable-Utility-Knife/5000204667). Lay the fabric over the sand, which will help to prevent weeds from growing between your pavers.

### Paver Installation

10. **Lay the Pavers:** 
    - Start at one corner of your area and lay your first [paver](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Four-cobble-Allegheny-Concrete-Patio-Stone-Common-16-in-x-16-in-Actual-15-7-in-x-15-7-in/4686349). Make sure it's straight and level. Continue to lay the pavers, keeping them close together and checking each one for level. Due to the size of your pavers, you should have 3 rows of 3 pavers each.

11. **Check and Adjust the Pavers:** 
    - Once all the pavers are laid, step back and check your work. If any pavers are out of alignment or not level, lift them up, add or remove sand underneath until level, then reposition them. You can use a piece of your [2x4 treated lumber](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Common-2-in-x-4-in-x-4-ft-Actual-1-5-in-x-3-5-in-x-4-ft-2-Prime-Square-Treated-Treated-Deck-Board/1001005914) and your [3-in 1 Vial Line/Surface Level](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Johnson-Level-3-in-Line-Surface-Level/1000085677) to span across multiple pavers and ensure they are at the same height. Once you're satisfied with your layout, use your rubber mallet to firmly set the pavers into the sand.

### Edging Installation (Optional)

12. **Install the Paver Restraint:** 
    - Cut your [Expert Edge Flexible Plastic Paver Restraint](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Expert-Edge-Paver-Restraint-6-Ft/1001464148) to the length of each side of your square. Place the cut restraint around the edge of your pavers.

13. **Anchor the Restraint:** 
    - Position the plastic paver restraint along the edge of the pavers with the lip under the pavers to help keep them in place. Using the [Expert Edge 16-Pack 8.5-in Black Plastic Paver Spike](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Expert-Edge-Anchoring-Spike-Pack-16-Ct/1002102488) and the rubber mallet, drive the spikes through the holes in the restraint and into the ground. You'll want to place a spike every 1.5-2 feet around the perimeter.

14. **Check the Edge:** 
    - Once all spikes are in place, check the edging to make sure it's secure and the spikes are flush with the ground.

This is a general guide, so depending on the specifics of your project, some steps may vary slightly. Always remember to wear appropriate safety gear, including [safety glasses](https://www.lowes.com/pd/3M-Gasket-Plastic-Anti-Fog-Safety-Glasses/1001879574), [work gloves](https://www.lowes.com/pd/CRAFTSMAN-Cowhide-Leather-Work-Glove-Large-Unisex-Leather-Multipurpose-Gloves/1000865862), and an optional [face mask](https://www.lowes.com/pd/3M-2-Pack-Disposable-Sanding-and-Fiberglass-Valved-Safety-Mask/1002710118) if you're sensitive to dust.

Congratulations! Your paver platform is now complete. Enjoy your new outdoor space!
