## Paver Platform Installation Guide

### Preparation

1. **Mark the Perimeter of Your Platform:** 
    - Begin by marking out the area where you'll be installing your paver platform. You can use your [tape measure](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Kobalt-Project-Source-25FT-Tape-Measure/5002026353) to measure a 4-foot by 4-foot area. Once measured, use [landscape stakes](https://www.lowes.com/pd/12-Pack-12-in-Wood-Landscape-Stake/1000404377) at each corner of the square to mark the perimeter. Drive these stakes into the ground using your hand or a mallet. 

2. **Attach Strings:** 
    - Once your stakes are in place, attach your [fluorescent orange nylon mason line string](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Marshalltown-250-ft-Fluorescent-Orange-Nylon-Mason-Line-String/5001845385) to the stakes. Tie the string around one stake, pull it taut, and then tie it to the next stake. Continue this process until you've outlined the entire square with the string. 

3. **Check the Square:** 
    - With your square marked out, it's time to make sure that it's actually square. Measure diagonally from one corner to another, and then from the other two corners. Both measurements should be the same. Adjust your stakes and strings as needed until they are. 

### Base Layer Installation

4. **Dig the Area:** 
    - Using the [square nose shovel](https://www.harborfreight.com/56-in-square-nose-shovel-69791.html), dig out the area inside your strings to a depth of about 6 inches. This will be the base layer for your platform, which will provide stability and help with drainage.

5. **Install the Gravel:** 
    - Pour the [gravel](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Sakrete-0-5-cu-ft-Gray-Gravel/1000489233) into the dug-out area. Use your shovel to spread the gravel evenly across the entire area, ensuring that it fills any low spots. This should be about 4 inches thick. 

6. **Compact the Gravel:** 
    - Use the [hand tamper](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Kobalt-10-in-x-10-in-Tamper-with-Steel-Handle/5005462239) to compact the gravel. This will create a firm and stable base for your platform. Make sure the surface of the gravel is as flat as possible. You can use your [48-in I-beam level](https://www.lowes.com/pd/CRAFTSMAN-48-in-I-beam-Level/1000596129) to check this.

7. **Install the Sand:** 
    - Pour the [sand](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Sakrete-50-lb-All-purpose-Sand/1000489239) over the compacted gravel. Use your shovel to spread it evenly across the entire area, creating a layer that's approximately 2 inches thick. 

8. **Compact and Level the Sand:** 
    - Use the hand tamper again to compact the sand. After compacting, use the 48-in I-beam level to ensure that the surface is level. If you find any high or low spots, add or remove sand as necessary and compact again. 

9. **Install the Landscape Fabric:** 
    - Cut the [landscape fabric](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Scotts/5004685485) to fit the area using your [utility knife](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Project-Source-Project-Source-Retractable-Utility-Knife/5000204667). Lay the fabric over the sand, which will help to prevent weeds from growing between your pavers.

### Paver Installation

10. **Lay the Pavers:** 
    - Start at one corner of your area and lay your first [paver](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Rubberific/5013800927). Make sure it's straight and level. Continue to lay the pavers, keeping them close together and checking each one for level.

11. **Check the Pavers:** 
    - Once all the pavers are laid, step back and check your work. If any pavers are uneven, you can adjust them by adding or removing sand underneath. 

12. **Final Touches:** 
    - Use your [broom](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Project-Source-Project-Source-Pro-Corn-Broom-750585/1002832838) to sweep the area clean of any debris. Now your paver platform is ready to use!

This is a general guide, so depending on the specifics of your project, some steps may vary slightly. Always remember to wear appropriate safety gear, including [safety glasses](https://www.lowes.com/pd/3M-Gasket-Plastic-Anti-Fog-Safety-Glasses/1001879574), [work gloves](https://www.lowes.com/pd/CRAFTSMAN-Cowhide-Leather-Work-Glove-Large-Unisex-Leather-Multipurpose-Gloves/1000865862), and an optional [face mask](https://www.lowes.com/pd/3M-2-Pack-Disposable-Sanding-and-Fiberglass-Valved-Safety-Mask/1002710118) if you're sensitive to dust.

Enjoy your new paver platform!
