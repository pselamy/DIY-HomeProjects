## Personal Equipment

Always wear sturdy footwear when doing heavy work to protect your feet.

## Steps

1. **Mark the Area:** Using the stakes, the mason's line, and the tape measure, outline the 48" x 48" square where you'll install the pavers. Make sure the area is squared up by measuring the diagonals, which should be equal.
2. **Preparation:** Clear the area of any grass, plants, or debris.
3. **Excavation:** With your shovel, dig out soil to a depth of about 4 inches. This will allow room for the crushed stone base and sand, as well as the thickness of your pavers.
4. **Adding Crushed Stone:** Spread the crushed bluestone evenly within the marked area, aiming for a depth of about 2.5 inches. Compact this layer with the tamper.
5. **Add Sand Layer:** Pour sand on top of the crushed stone layer. Aim for a depth of about 1 inch of sand. Use the long, straight board to screed the sand, creating a flat and level surface for the pavers.
6. **Check the Level:** Place the 48-in I-beam level on top of the sand. It should appear even across the entire area. If it isn't, adjust the sand as necessary.
7. **Laying the Pavers:** Starting at one corner of your area, place the pavers down onto the sand, keeping them as straight as possible. Continue until all pavers are laid, maintaining the pattern.
8. **Fill in the Joints:** With the sand and your broom, sweep sand into the cracks between the pavers. This will help hold the pavers in place and prevent them from moving.

Remember, safety first! Wear your gloves, safety glasses, sturdy footwear, and optionally, your safety mask if sensitive to dust. Enjoy your project!
