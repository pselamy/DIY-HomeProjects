## Paver Platform Installation Guide

Sure, I understand you'd like more detailed steps. Here's how to proceed with your specific materials and dimensions:

### Preparation
**Mark the Perimeter of Your Platform:**

- Measure a 4-foot by 4-foot area with your tape measure.
- Drive an 18-in wood landscape stake into the ground at each corner of the square using your hand or a rubber mallet. 
- Attach your fluorescent orange nylon mason line string to the stakes, creating a square outline.

**Check the Square:**

- Measure diagonally from one corner to another, and then from the other two corners. If measurements aren't the same, adjust stakes and strings until they are.

### Base Layer Installation
**Dig the Area:**

- Using the square nose shovel, dig out the area inside your strings to a depth of about 5-6 inches, enough to accommodate the pavers and the base layers.

**Install the Gravel:**

- Pour the gravel into the dug-out area and spread it evenly to a thickness of about 3 inches.

**Compact the Gravel:**

- Compact the gravel using the hand tamper, and check for level using your 24-in I-beam level.

**Install the Sand:**

- Spread a 1-inch layer of sand evenly over the gravel.

**Compact and Level the Sand:**

- Compact the sand using the tamper, and ensure that the surface is level using your 24-in I-beam level.

**Install the Landscape Fabric:**

- Cut and lay the landscape fabric over the sand to prevent weeds from growing between your pavers.

### Paver Installation
**Lay the Pavers:**

- Start at one corner and lay your first paver, ensuring it's straight and level. 
- Continue to lay the pavers, keeping them close together. Since you're using 16-inch pavers, you should have 3 rows of 3 pavers each.

**Check and Adjust the Pavers:**

- Check each paver for alignment and level. If necessary, adjust the sand underneath them.
- Use your rubber mallet to firmly set the pavers into the sand.

### Edging Installation
**Install the Paver Restraint (Optional):**

- Cut your flexible paver restraint to the length of each side of your square and place it around the edge of the pavers.

**Anchor the Restraint (Optional):**

- Position the paver restraint with the lip under the pavers to keep them in place.
- Drive the spikes through the holes in the restraint and into the ground at intervals of about 1.5-2 feet around the perimeter.

**Check the Edge (Optional):**

- Ensure that all spikes are flush with the ground and the edging is secure.

Congratulations! Your paver platform is now complete. Enjoy your new outdoor space!

Remember to always wear appropriate safety gear, including safety glasses, work gloves, and a dust mask if necessary. These instructions may need slight adjustments depending on your specific situation.
